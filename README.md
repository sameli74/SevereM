# SevereM
A system suggesting most important environmental factors that affect car accidents using a forest of decision trees. 

# Dataset
In this work KSI dataset is used. This dataset includes all traffic collisions events where a person was either Killed or Seriously Injured (KSI) from 2006 â€“ 2019.

# Motivaton
Each year many car accidents happen, and a large portion of them cause fatal or major injuries. By investigating Toronto police data, it turned out that half of the occurred accidents in Toronto were hazardous. Thus, focusing on minimizing these accidents could be beneficial to the society. severeM uses actual data of traffic collisions and focuses on environmental factors, since human related factors are beyond controls.
